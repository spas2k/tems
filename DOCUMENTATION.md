## 1. What Is TEMS?

**TEMS** stands for **Telecom Expense Management System**. It is a full-stack web application designed to help businesses track and manage all of their telecommunications expenses in one centralized place.

Think of it like a digital filing cabinet combined with a smart spreadsheet — it keeps all your telecom vendor information, contracts, circuit details, invoices, and cost savings opportunities organized and accessible from a web browser.

### What Can You Do With TEMS?

- **Manage vendor accounts** — Keep track of who your telecom providers are (AT&T, Verizon, etc.)
- **Track contracts** — Know when contracts expire, what rates you agreed to, and whether they auto-renew
- **Monitor circuits** — See all your telecom circuits (internet connections, phone lines, etc.) in one inventory
- **Process invoices** — Review monthly bills, check for billing errors, and verify charges match contracted rates
- **Track orders** — Follow new service orders from placement through completion
- **Allocate costs** — Split telecom costs across departments and cost centers
- **Identify savings** — Flag billing errors and negotiation opportunities to save money
- **Manage USOC codes** — Maintain a catalog of Universal Service Order Codes with default MRC/NRC rates
- **Track billing disputes** — File, monitor, and resolve billing disputes with vendors
- **Validate rates against contracts** — Automatically compare line-item charges to contracted rates and flag mismatches
- **Export data to CSV** — Download dispute lists and rate audit results as CSV files

## 2. What Problem Does TEMS Solve?

Imagine a medium-to-large company that uses services from 5–10 different telecom vendors. Every month, they receive a stack of invoices. Each invoice has multiple line items. Each line item corresponds to a specific circuit or service. The contracted rate might be different from what's actually billed.

**Without TEMS**, someone has to:
- Open each invoice manually
- Look up what the contracted rate should be
- Calculate if there's an overcharge
- Track which department should pay for each charge
- Remember when contracts expire
- Keep spreadsheets updated across teams

**With TEMS**, all of this is automated and centralized:
- Invoices are logged with line items that auto-calculate variance (overcharge/undercharge)
- Contracts show expiration warnings
- Savings opportunities are tracked from identification through resolution
- Costs are allocated to departments with percentage splits
- A dashboard gives instant visibility into the entire telecom portfolio

## 3. Key Concepts & Terminology

Before diving into the code, let's understand the business concepts that TEMS manages. Each of these is a "thing" (entity) stored in the database:

### Account
A **vendor account** represents a relationship with a telecom provider. For example, your company might have an account with AT&T and another with Verizon. Each account stores the vendor's name, account number, contact information, and status.

### Contract
A **contract** is a legal agreement between your company and a vendor. It specifies the price you'll pay (the "contracted rate"), how long the agreement lasts (the "term"), and whether it automatically renews. One vendor account can have multiple contracts.

### Circuit
A **circuit** is a specific telecommunications service or connection. Examples include:
- An internet connection (DIA — Dedicated Internet Access)
- An MPLS connection (a type of private network)
- A wireless phone line
- A fiber-optic link between two locations

Each circuit belongs to an account and is usually tied to a contract. It has a physical location, bandwidth (speed), and a monthly cost.

### Order
An **order** is a request to install, modify, or disconnect a circuit. When you sign up for a new internet line, the vendor creates an order to provision (set up) that circuit. Orders track the lifecycle from request through completion.

### Invoice
An **invoice** is a monthly bill from a vendor. It has a total amount, billing period, due date, and payment status. Each invoice contains one or more **line items**.

### Line Item
A **line item** is a single charge on an invoice. For example, one invoice might have:
- Line Item 1: MPLS circuit monthly charge — $1,850.00
- Line Item 2: DIA circuit monthly charge — $750.00
- Line Item 3: Federal USF surcharge (tax) — $190.00

Each line item compares the **billed amount** (what you were actually charged) against the **contracted rate** (what you should have been charged). The difference is called the **variance**. A positive variance means you were overcharged.

### Allocation
An **allocation** splits a line item's cost across different departments or cost centers. For example, if a $1,850 circuit charge needs to be split between IT (60%) and Sales (40%), you'd create two allocations:
- IT: $1,110.00 (60%)
- Sales: $740.00 (40%)

### Cost Saving
A **cost saving** represents an opportunity to save money. This could be:
- A billing error (you were overcharged)
- A contract optimization (market rates have dropped, time to renegotiate)
- A duplicate service (paying for something you don't use)

Each cost saving tracks the projected savings amount, the current status, and whether the savings have been realized (actually gotten back).

### USOC Code
A **USOC code** (Universal Service Order Code) is a standardized code used by telecom carriers to identify specific services or features on a bill. For example:
- Code `1LN` might represent "Basic Local Line"
- Code `MPBXS` might represent "MPLS Port — Small"

Each USOC code has a default **MRC** (Monthly Recurring Charge) and **NRC** (Non-Recurring Charge). TEMS uses these codes to categorize line items and validate billing accuracy.

### Contract Rate
A **contract rate** links a USOC code to a specific contract, defining the agreed MRC and NRC for that service under that contract. When invoices arrive, TEMS compares actual charges against these contracted rates to identify overcharges.

### Dispute
A **dispute** is a formal record of a billing disagreement filed with a vendor. It tracks the disputed amount, type (Overcharge, Missing Credit, Wrong Rate, Duplicate Charge, Service Issue), current status (Open, Under Review, Escalated, Credited, Denied, Closed), and any credits received back.

### Rate Audit / Validation
**Rate validation** is the automated process of comparing every MRC/NRC line-item charge against its corresponding contract rate. Items are flagged as:
- **Validated** — The billed amount matches the contracted rate
- **Variance** — The billed amount differs from the contracted rate
- **Pending** — No contracted rate was provided for comparison
- **Unmatched / Orphan** — The line item references a USOC code with no contract rate on file

### Audit Status
Every line item carries an **audit status** that is automatically computed when the line item is created or updated. This status drives the audit status bar on the Dashboard and the Rate Audit page.

## 4. Technology Stack Explained

This section explains every technology used in TEMS, what it does, and why it was chosen.

### Front-End (Client) — What the User Sees

| Technology | What It Is | Why It's Used |
|---|---|---|
| **React 18** | A JavaScript library for building user interfaces | Creates reusable, interactive UI components. When data changes, React efficiently updates only the parts of the screen that need to change. |
| **React Router DOM 6** | Navigation library for React | Enables multiple "pages" in a single-page application (SPA). Instead of loading a whole new HTML page, it swaps out components instantly. |
| **Vite 5** | A build tool and development server | Makes development fast — when you save a file, changes appear in the browser almost instantly (Hot Module Replacement). Also bundles your code for production. |
| **Axios** | HTTP client library | Sends requests to the server API. Makes it easy to do GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests and handle responses. |
| **Chakra UI 3** | Component library | Provides styled, accessible UI components. TEMS uses it mainly for the provider wrapper and some utilities. |
| **Lucide React** | Icon library | Provides all the icons you see in the sidebar, buttons, and tables (e.g., the building icon, the pencil icon, the trash icon). |
| **Day.js** | Date utility library | Formats dates (e.g., "2026-02-15" → "Feb 15, 2026") and calculates date differences (e.g., "expires in 45 days"). |

### Back-End (Server) — What Runs Behind the Scenes

| Technology | What It Is | Why It's Used |
|---|---|---|
| **Node.js** | JavaScript runtime for servers | Lets you run JavaScript outside a web browser, so you can build server applications. |
| **Express 4** | Web framework for Node.js | Handles HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and routes them to the appropriate handler functions. |
| **Knex.js** | SQL query builder | Builds database queries using JavaScript instead of raw SQL strings. Supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MSSQL — switching databases requires only a config change, not rewriting queries. Also provides migrations (schema versioning) and seeds (demo data). |
| **PostgreSQL** | Relational database (current) | Stores all the data in structured tables. TEMS currently uses PostgreSQL. The Knex query builder means switching to MySQL or MSSQL requires only a config change. |
| **pg** | PostgreSQL driver for Node.js | The underlying driver that Knex uses to talk to PostgreSQL. If you switch to MySQL, you'd install `mysql2` instead; for MSSQL, `tedious`. |
| **cors** | Cross-Origin Resource Sharing middleware | Allows the front-end (running on port 2000) to make requests to the back-end (running on port 2001). |
| **dotenv** | Environment variable loader | Reads database credentials from a `.env` file so they aren't hard-coded in the source code. |
| **uuid** | Unique ID generator | Generates universally unique identifiers (used in mock data). |
| **nodemon** | Development auto-restart tool | Automatically restarts the server when you save changes to server files, so you don't have to manually stop and restart. |

## 6. Prerequisites — What You Need Before Starting

Before you can run this project, you need the following software installed on your computer:

### 1. Node.js (version 18 or higher)

**What is it?** Node.js lets you run JavaScript on your computer (not just in a browser).

**How to install:**
1. Go to [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
2. Download the **LTS** (Long Term Support) version
3. Run the installer — accept all defaults
4. Verify it worked by opening a terminal and typing:
   ```
   node --version
   ```
   You should see something like `v18.17.0` or higher.

Node.js comes with **npm** (Node Package Manager), which installs code libraries. Verify with:
```
npm --version
```

### 2. PostgreSQL (version 14 or higher)

**What is it?** PostgreSQL is a relational database — it stores all the application data in organized tables.

**How to install:**
1. Go to [https://www.postgresql.org/download/](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
2. Download PostgreSQL for your operating system
3. Run the installer
4. During setup, you'll be asked to create a **superuser password** — remember this!
5. Verify it worked:
   ```
   psql --version
   ```

> **Tip:** You can also install PostgreSQL through Docker, Homebrew (macOS), or your Linux package manager.

### 3. A Code Editor (Recommended: VS Code)

**What is it?** A text editor designed for writing code.

**How to install:** Go to [https://code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com) and download it.

### 4. A Terminal / Command Prompt

You'll need a terminal to run commands. Options:
- **Windows:** PowerShell (built-in) or Windows Terminal
- **Mac:** Terminal (built-in)
- **Linux:** Any terminal emulator

## 7. Installation & Setup Guide

Follow these steps in order:

### Step 1: Get the Code

If you have the project folder already, skip this step. Otherwise, download or clone the repository to your computer.

### Step 2: Create the PostgreSQL Database

Open a terminal and connect to PostgreSQL:

```bash
psql -U postgres
```

Enter your superuser password when prompted. Then create the database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE tems;
```

> You can name it anything — just update the `DB_NAME` in your `.env` file to match.

### Step 3: Create the Environment File

The server needs to know how to connect to your database. Create a file called `.env` in the `server/` folder:

```
server/.env
```

Add these contents (replace `your_password` with your actual PostgreSQL password):

```env
DB_CLIENT=pg
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=tems
PORT=2001
```

**What does each line mean?**
- `DB_CLIENT=pg` — Use the PostgreSQL driver
- `DB_HOST=localhost` — The database is on your own computer
- `DB_PORT=5432` — PostgreSQL's default port number
- `DB_USER=postgres` — The PostgreSQL username
- `DB_PASSWORD=your_password` — Your PostgreSQL password
- `DB_NAME=tems` — Which database to use
- `PORT=2001` — Which port the API server runs on

### Step 4: Install Server Dependencies & Populate the Database

Open a terminal, navigate to the `server/` folder, install the required packages, and run migrations + seeds:

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run migrate
npm run seed
```

- `npm install` reads `package.json` and downloads all the libraries the server needs (Express, Knex, PostgreSQL driver, etc.) into a `node_modules/` folder.
- `npm run migrate` creates all 45 database tables using the Knex migrations (16 migration files).
- `npm run seed` fills the tables with roles, permissions, and demo data.

To tear down and rebuild at any time:
```bash
npm run migrate:rollback   # Drop all tables
npm run migrate            # Re-create tables
npm run seed               # Re-insert demo data
```

> **Note:** Always use the Knex migration and seed approach above.

### Step 5: Install Client Dependencies

Open a **new** terminal (or navigate to the `client/` folder):

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

This downloads all the front-end libraries (React, Axios, etc.).

### Step 6: Start the Server

In the `server/` folder:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
PostgreSQL connected
TEMS API server running on port 2001
```

If you see a connection error, double-check your `.env` file credentials.

### Step 7: Start the Client

In a **separate** terminal, in the `client/` folder:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
  VITE v5.x.x  ready in xxx ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:2000/
```

### Step 8: Open the App

Open your web browser and go to: **http://localhost:2000**

You should see the TEMS dashboard with live data!

## 8. How the Application Works (Architecture)

### The Big Picture

TEMS uses a **client-server architecture** — a very common pattern in web development:

1. **The Client (Front-End)** runs in your web browser. It's responsible for:
   - Displaying the user interface (buttons, tables, forms)
   - Handling user interactions (clicking, typing, navigating)
   - Sending requests to the server when it needs data

2. **The Server (Back-End)** runs on your computer as a separate process. It's responsible for:
   - Receiving requests from the client
   - Querying the database for data
   - Sending data back to the client as JSON

3. **The Database** stores all persistent data in structured tables.

### Request-Response Cycle

Here's what happens when you open the Dashboard page:

```
1. You type http://localhost:2000 in your browser
   ↓
2. Vite serves index.html + your React code to the browser
   ↓
3. React renders the Dashboard component
   ↓
4. Dashboard calls getDashboard() from api.js
   ↓
5. Axios sends GET http://localhost:2000/api/dashboard
   ↓
6. Vite's proxy forwards this to http://localhost:2001/api/dashboard
   ↓
7. Express receives the request and runs the dashboard handler in server.js
   ↓
8. The handler sends SQL queries to PostgreSQL
   ↓
9. PostgreSQL returns the results
   ↓
10. The handler packages results into a JSON object and sends it back
    ↓
11. Axios receives the JSON response
    ↓
12. React updates the page with the data (cards, tables fill in)
```

### What Is a "Proxy"?

In development, the client runs on `http://localhost:2000` and the server on `http://localhost:2001`. Normally, the browser would block requests from one to the other (for security). The **proxy** in `vite.config.js` solves this:

```javascript
proxy: {
  '/api': {
    target: 'http://localhost:2001',
    changeOrigin: true,
  },
},
```

This tells Vite: "When the browser requests any URL starting with `/api`, secretly forward it to `http://localhost:2001`." The browser doesn't even know it's talking to a different server.

### Single-Page Application (SPA)

TEMS is a **Single-Page Application**. This means:
- The browser loads ONE HTML page (`index.html`) at startup
- When you navigate (e.g., from Dashboard to Accounts), React **swaps components** — it does NOT load a new HTML page from the server
- This makes navigation feel instant and smooth
- The URL bar still changes (thanks to React Router) so you can bookmark pages

---

## 9. Database Design (Data Model)

The database has **45 tables** across 16 migration files. For the full current schema, see [DATABASE_SCHEMA_recreated.md](DATABASE_SCHEMA_recreated.md). Here's every table, every column, and what it stores.

> **Naming Convention:** Every table's primary key is named `{table_name}_id` (e.g., `accounts_id`, `circuits_id`). Foreign keys match the referenced table's PK name (e.g., `accounts_id` in `contracts` refers to `accounts.accounts_id`). The one special case is the `circuits` table where the vendor's circuit identifier is stored in `circuit_number` (to avoid collision with the PK `circuits_id`).

## 10. Server (Back-End) Detailed Walkthrough

### File: `server/server.js` — The Main Server

This is the entry point for the back-end. Here's what it does, line by line:

```javascript
require('dotenv').config();          // Load .env file into process.env
const express = require('express');   // Import Express framework
const cors = require('cors');         // Import CORS middleware
const db = require('./db');           // Import database connection

const app = express();                // Create an Express application
app.use(cors());                      // Allow cross-origin requests
app.use(express.json());             // Parse JSON request bodies
```

**What is middleware?** Middleware is code that runs on every request before it reaches the route handler. `cors()` adds headers that allow browser requests. `express.json()` reads the request body and makes it available as `req.body`.

Then it registers all the route files:

```javascript
app.use('/api/accounts',       require('./routes/accounts'));
app.use('/api/contracts',      require('./routes/contracts'));
app.use('/api/circuits',       require('./routes/circuits'));
app.use('/api/orders',         require('./routes/orders'));
app.use('/api/invoices',       require('./routes/invoices'));
app.use('/api/line-items',     require('./routes/lineItems'));
app.use('/api/allocations',    require('./routes/allocations'));
app.use('/api/allocation-rules', require('./routes/allocationRules'));
app.use('/api/bank-cost-centers', require('./routes/bankCostCenters'));
app.use('/api/cost-savings',   require('./routes/costSavings'));
app.use('/api/search',         require('./routes/search'));
app.use('/api/usoc-codes',     require('./routes/usocCodes'));
app.use('/api/contract-rates', require('./routes/contractRates'));
app.use('/api/disputes',       require('./routes/disputes'));
app.use('/api/vendors',        require('./routes/vendors'));
app.use('/api/locations',      require('./routes/locations'));
app.use('/api/field-catalog',  require('./routes/fieldCatalog'));
app.use('/api/vendor-remit',   require('./routes/vendorRemit'));
app.use('/api/announcements',  require('./routes/announcements'));
app.use('/api/spend-categories', require('./routes/spendCategories'));
app.use('/api/users',          require('./routes/users'));
app.use('/api/roles',          require('./routes/roles'));
app.use('/api/batch-upload',   require('./routes/batchUpload'));
app.use('/api/invoice-reader', require('./routes/invoiceReader'));
app.use('/api/notes',          require('./routes/notes'));
app.use('/api/favorites',      require('./routes/favorites'));
app.use('/api/tickets',        require('./routes/tickets'));
app.use('/api/reports',        require('./routes/reports'));
app.use('/api/notifications',  require('./routes/notifications'));
```

This means: "When someone makes a request to `/api/accounts/...`, hand it off to the `accounts.js` route file." The same pattern applies for all 27 route files.

The file also contains two endpoints defined directly:

**Dashboard endpoint** — runs 14 database queries in parallel to gather all summary statistics:

```javascript
app.get('/api/dashboard', async (req, res) => {
  // Runs 14 database queries to get summary statistics:
  //  - totalAccounts, activeContracts, activeCircuits, openInvoices
  //  - totalBilled, totalVariance, totalSavingsIdentified, pendingOrders
  //  - totalMrc (sum of line_items.mrc_amount)
  //  - totalNrc (sum of line_items.nrc_amount)
  //  - auditCounts (validated/variance/pending from line_items.audit_status)
  //  - openDisputes (count where status ≠ 'Closed')
  //  - recentInvoices (top 5), savingsOpportunities, recentVariances (top 10)
});
```

**Rate Validation endpoint** — compares line-item charges against contract rates:

```javascript
app.get('/api/rate-validation', async (req, res) => {
  // Joins line_items → usoc_codes → contract_rates
  // Computes mrc_delta, nrc_delta, mrc_match, nrc_match, compliant
  // Returns { summary: { total, matched, mismatched, noRate }, items: [...] }
});
```

### File: `server/db.js` — Database Connection (Knex)

This creates a **Knex instance** that connects to the database:

```javascript
const knex = require('knex');
const config = require('./knexfile');

const db = knex(config[process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development']);
```

Knex is a **query builder** — it lets you write database queries in JavaScript instead of raw SQL strings. The same queries work on MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MSSQL.

**Connection pooling** is handled automatically by Knex. It creates a few connections upfront and reuses them across requests. The pool is configured in `knexfile.js` with `min: 2` / `max: 10`.

The file also exports a **helper function** for inserting rows:

```javascript
db.insertReturningId = async function (table, data) {
  const pkColumn = `${table}_id`;                    // e.g. accounts_id, circuits_id
  const result = await this(table).insert(data).returning(pkColumn);
  const first = result[0];
  return typeof first === 'object' ? first[pkColumn] : first;
};
```

This helper handles a cross-database difference: MySQL returns the new ID as a number, while PostgreSQL/MSSQL return it as an object `{ accounts_id: 5 }`. The helper normalizes this so all routes work identically on any database. It derives the primary key column name automatically using the convention `{table_name}_id`.

### File: `server/knexfile.js` — Database Configuration

This file tells Knex how to connect to the database:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  development: {
    client: process.env.DB_CLIENT || 'pg',
    connection: {
      host: process.env.DB_HOST || 'localhost',
      port: parseInt(process.env.DB_PORT) || 5432,
      user: process.env.DB_USER || 'postgres',
      password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD || '',
      database: process.env.DB_NAME || 'tems',
    },
    pool: { min: 2, max: 10 },
    migrations: { directory: './migrations' },
    seeds: { directory: './seeds' },
  },
};
```

**To switch databases**, change the `DB_CLIENT` environment variable:
- PostgreSQL: `DB_CLIENT=pg` (default)
- MySQL: `DB_CLIENT=mysql2`
- MSSQL: `DB_CLIENT=mssql`

### Route Files — The CRUD Pattern (Knex Query Builder)

Every route file follows the same pattern using Knex's chainable query builder. Let's understand it using `routes/accounts.js` as an example:

#### GET All (List)
```javascript
router.get('/', async (req, res) => {
  const rows = await db('accounts').orderBy('name');
  res.json(rows);
});
```
- **What it does:** Returns all accounts, sorted by name
- `db('accounts')` tells Knex which table to query
- `.orderBy('name')` adds `ORDER BY name` to the query
- Knex automatically builds the SQL and returns results as an array

#### GET One (Detail)
```javascript
router.get('/:id', async (req, res) => {
  const row = await db('accounts').where('accounts_id', req.params.id).first();
  if (!row) return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Not found' });
  res.json(row);
});
```
- `.where('accounts_id', req.params.id)` adds a `WHERE accounts_id = ?` clause (Knex parameterizes values automatically to prevent SQL injection)
- `.first()` returns a single object instead of an array

#### POST (Create)
```javascript
router.post('/', async (req, res) => {
  const { name, account_number, ... } = req.body;
  const id = await db.insertReturningId('accounts', {
    name, account_number, ...
  });
  const row = await db('accounts').where('accounts_id', id).first();
  res.status(201).json(row);
});
```
- `db.insertReturningId()` is a custom helper that inserts a row and returns its new ID — works on MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MSSQL
- After inserting, we fetch the full new row and return it

#### PUT (Update)
```javascript
router.put('/:id', async (req, res) => {
  const { name, account_number, ... } = req.body;
  await db('accounts').where('accounts_id', req.params.id).update({
    name, account_number, ...
  });
  const row = await db('accounts').where('accounts_id', req.params.id).first();
  res.json(row);
});
```
- `.update({...})` generates an `UPDATE ... SET ...` query

#### DELETE
```javascript
router.delete('/:id', async (req, res) => {
  await db('accounts').where('accounts_id', req.params.id).del();
  res.json({ success: true });
});
```
- `.del()` generates a `DELETE FROM ... WHERE ...` query

### The `baseQuery()` Pattern

Most route files define a `baseQuery()` helper function that pre-configures JOINs and column selections:

```javascript
function baseQuery() {
  return db('circuits as ci')
    .leftJoin('accounts as a', 'ci.accounts_id', 'a.accounts_id')
    .leftJoin('contracts as co', 'ci.contracts_id', 'co.contracts_id')
    .leftJoin('orders as o', 'ci.orders_id', 'o.orders_id')
    .select('ci.*', 'a.name as account_name', 'co.contract_number', 'o.order_number');
}

// Usage:
const rows = await baseQuery().where('ci.status', 'Active');      // List
const row  = await baseQuery().where('ci.circuits_id', 5).first();  // Single
```

This avoids duplicating the same JOIN logic across GET endpoints.

### Special Route Features

Some routes have extra capabilities:

- **Filtering:** `GET /api/contracts?accounts_id=1` returns only contracts for account #1. The route handler conditionally chains `.where()` calls based on query parameters.

- **Joins:** Most routes use Knex `.leftJoin()` to include related data. For example, getting a circuit also returns the account name, contract number, and order number.

- **Nested Resources:** `GET /api/accounts/:id/circuits` returns all circuits belonging to a specific account. `GET /api/contracts/:id/orders` returns all orders under a specific contract.

- **Calculated Fields:** When creating/updating a line item, the server automatically calculates `variance = amount - contracted_rate`.

### File: `server/routes/search.js` — Global Search

The search endpoint accepts a query string and searches across **6 tables** simultaneously using Knex:

```javascript
router.get('/', async (req, res) => {
  const q = req.query.q;  // Get search term from URL: /api/search?q=ATT
  const like = `%${q}%`;  // Add wildcards for partial matching
  
  // Search all 6 tables in parallel using Knex
  const [accounts, contracts, circuits, orders, invoices, usoc_codes] = await Promise.all([
    db('accounts as a').select('a.accounts_id', 'a.name', 'a.account_number as sub')
      .where('a.name', 'like', like).orWhere('a.account_number', 'like', like).limit(6),
    db('contracts as c').leftJoin('accounts as a', 'c.accounts_id', 'a.accounts_id')
      .select('c.contracts_id', 'c.name', 'a.name as sub')
      .where('c.contract_number', 'like', like).orWhere('c.name', 'like', like).limit(6),
    // ... circuits, orders, invoices ...
    db('usoc_codes as u').select('u.usoc_codes_id', 'u.usoc_code', 'u.description')
      .where('u.usoc_code', 'like', like).orWhere('u.description', 'like', like).limit(6),
  ]);
  
  res.json({ accounts, contracts, circuits, orders, invoices, usoc_codes });
});
```

**`.where('column', 'like', pattern)`** uses Knex's chainable syntax for `LIKE` queries. On MySQL and MSSQL, `LIKE` is case-insensitive by default. For PostgreSQL, you would change `'like'` to `'ilike'` for case-insensitive matching.

**`Promise.all()`** runs all 6 searches simultaneously instead of one after another, making search much faster.

### New Route Files

Three additional route files follow the same CRUD pattern described above:

- **`routes/usocCodes.js`** — CRUD for USOC codes. Supports optional `?category=` and `?status=` query filters. 
- **`routes/contractRates.js`** — CRUD for contract rates. Base query joins `contracts`, `usoc_codes`, and `accounts` to return rich data. Supports `?contracts_id=` and `?usoc_codes_id=` filters.
- **`routes/disputes.js`** — CRUD for disputes. Base query joins `invoices`, `accounts`, and `line_items` to include vendor name, invoice number, and line item description in every response.

### Additional Route Files

These route files were added for administration, collaboration, and supplemental modules:

- **`routes/users.js`** — Full user management CRUD. `GET /:id` returns enriched data with `assigned_invoices_count`, `assigned_orders_count`, and `audit_actions_count`. Sub-routes: `GET /:id/invoices`, `GET /:id/orders`, `GET /:id/activity`. Status validation includes Active, Inactive, and Suspended.
- **`routes/roles.js`** — CRUD for roles and permissions. Includes audit-log query endpoint with resource whitelist.
- **`routes/notifications.js`** — `GET /` returns notifications for the current user. `PATCH /:id/read` marks one as read. `PATCH /read-all` marks all as read.
- **`routes/tickets.js`** — CRUD for tickets with ticket_comments sub-resource.
- **`routes/notes.js`** — Polymorphic notes CRUD (entity_type + entity_id pattern).
- **`routes/favorites.js`** — User favorites CRUD.
- **`routes/vendors.js`**, **`routes/locations.js`**, **`routes/fieldCatalog.js`**, **`routes/vendorRemit.js`**, **`routes/announcements.js`**, **`routes/spendCategories.js`** — Standard CRUD for supplemental reference tables.
- **`routes/batchUpload.js`** — Batch import via Excel templates.
- **`routes/invoiceReader.js`** — Multi-format invoice parsing and batch import (EDI, Excel, PDF).
- **`routes/reports.js`** — Saved report CRUD and report execution.

## 11. Client (Front-End) Detailed Walkthrough

### File: `client/index.html` — The Shell

This is the only HTML file in the entire application. It contains:

```html
<div id="root"></div>
<script type="module" src="/src/main.jsx"></script>
```

The `<div id="root">` is where React will insert the entire application. The `<script>` tag loads the React code.

### File: `client/src/main.jsx` — The Entry Point

```jsx
ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <ChakraProvider value={defaultSystem}>
      <App />
    </ChakraProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

This code:
1. Finds the `<div id="root">` in the HTML
2. Wraps the entire app in `ChakraProvider` (UI system) and `React.StrictMode` (development helper)
3. Renders the `<App />` component — which is the entire application

### File: `client/src/api.js` — The API Layer

This file is the **single source of truth** for all server communication. Every API call in the entire application goes through this file.

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';

const api = axios.create({ baseURL: '/api' });

// Accounts
export const getAccounts = () => api.get('/accounts');
export const getAccount  = id => api.get(`/accounts/${id}`);
export const createAccount = d => api.post('/accounts', d);
export const updateAccount = (id, d) => api.put(`/accounts/${id}`, d);
export const deleteAccount = id => api.delete(`/accounts/${id}`);
// ... same pattern for contracts, circuits, orders, invoices, line items, allocations, cost savings

// USOC Codes
export const getUsocCodes   = params => api.get('/usoc-codes', { params });
export const getUsocCode    = id => api.get(`/usoc-codes/${id}`);
export const createUsocCode = d => api.post('/usoc-codes', d);
export const updateUsocCode = (id, d) => api.put(`/usoc-codes/${id}`, d);
export const deleteUsocCode = id => api.delete(`/usoc-codes/${id}`);

// Contract Rates
export const getContractRates   = params => api.get('/contract-rates', { params });
export const getContractRate    = id => api.get(`/contract-rates/${id}`);
export const createContractRate = d => api.post('/contract-rates', d);
export const updateContractRate = (id, d) => api.put(`/contract-rates/${id}`, d);
export const deleteContractRate = id => api.delete(`/contract-rates/${id}`);

// Disputes
export const getDisputes   = params => api.get('/disputes', { params });
export const getDispute    = id => api.get(`/disputes/${id}`);
export const createDispute = d => api.post('/disputes', d);
export const updateDispute = (id, d) => api.put(`/disputes/${id}`, d);
export const deleteDispute = id => api.delete(`/disputes/${id}`);

// Rate Validation
export const getRateValidation = () => api.get('/rate-validation');

// Global Search
export const globalSearch = q => api.get('/search', { params: { q } });
```

**Why is this useful?**
- All API URLs are defined in one place — if the server URL changes, you only update this file
- Each function has a clear name that describes what it does
- The `baseURL: '/api'` means every request automatically starts with `/api`

### File: `client/src/App.jsx` — The Main Layout

This is the most important React file. It defines the overall page layout and Navigation.

#### The Layout Structure

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ┌───────────┐  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐  │
│ │           │  │  HEADER (page title, search bar, date, user) │  │

│ └───────────┘  └──────────────────────────────────────────────┘  │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### The Sidebar

The sidebar has:
- **TEMS logo** at the top with a dollar sign icon
- **11 navigation items** — one for each main section, each expandable into sub-items
- **Collapse toggle** at the bottom — click to shrink the sidebar to just icons
- **Active state highlighting** — the current page is highlighted

The navigation items are defined as an array with nested `children` for sub-menus:

```javascript
const NAV = [
  { path: '/',             icon: LayoutDashboard, label: 'Dashboard' },
  { path: '/accounts',     icon: Building2,       label: 'Accounts',
    children: [
      { path: '/accounts',          label: 'All Accounts' },
      { path: '/service-providers', label: 'Service Providers' },
      { path: '/gl-codes',          label: 'GL Codes' },
    ],
  },
  { path: '/contracts',    icon: FileText,        label: 'Contracts',
    children: [
      { path: '/contracts',  label: 'All Contracts' },
      { path: '/usoc-codes', label: 'USOC Codes' },
      { path: '/disputes',   label: 'Disputes' },
      { path: '/rate-audit', label: 'Rate Audit' },
    ],
  },
  { path: '/circuits',     icon: Network,         label: 'Circuits',
    children: [
      { path: '/circuits',     label: 'All Circuits' },
      { path: '/cost-savings', label: 'Cost Savings' },
      { path: '/projects',     label: 'Projects' },
    ],
  },
  { path: '/orders',       icon: ShoppingCart,    label: 'Orders',
    children: [
      { path: '/orders',     label: 'All Orders' },
      { path: '/milestones', label: 'Milestones' },
    ],
  },
  { path: '/invoices',     icon: Receipt,         label: 'Invoices',
    children: [
      { path: '/invoices',          label: 'All Invoices' },
      { path: '/invoice-reader',    label: 'Invoice Reader' },
      { path: '/allocations',       label: 'Allocations' },
      { path: '/invoice-approvers', label: 'Invoice Approvers' },
    ],
  },
  { path: '/reports',      icon: BarChart2,       label: 'Reports',
    children: [
      { path: '/reports',       label: 'All Reports' },
      { path: '/create-graph',  label: 'Create Graph' },
      { path: '/create-report', label: 'Create Report' },
    ],
  },
  { path: '/administration', icon: Wrench, label: 'Administration', adminOnly: true,
    children: [
      { path: '/batch-upload', label: 'Batch Upload' },
      { path: '/users',        label: 'Users' },
    ],
  },
  { path: '/audit-log',    icon: Shield,          label: 'Audit Log', adminOnly: true },
];
```

#### The Header

The header has three sections (using CSS Grid):
1. **Left:** Current page title and subtitle
2. **Center:** Global search bar
3. **Right:** Today's date and a user avatar

#### Global Search

The search bar is a powerful feature that searches across all data types simultaneously:

1. User types at least 2 characters
2. After a 300ms pause (debounce — prevents searching on every keystroke), an API call is made
3. Results appear in a dropdown, grouped by type (Accounts, Contracts, Circuits, etc.)
4. Each result is color-coded and clickable — clicking navigates to that item's detail page

#### The Router (Page Switching)

React Router maps URLs to components:

```jsx
<Routes>
  <Route path="/"             element={<Dashboard />} />
  <Route path="/accounts"     element={<Accounts />} />
  <Route path="/accounts/:id" element={<AccountDetail />} />
  // ... etc.
</Routes>
```

When you navigate to `/accounts`, React displays the `<Accounts />` component. When you navigate to `/accounts/3`, it displays `<AccountDetail />` and the `:id` parameter is `3`.

#### Breadcrumb Navigation

The breadcrumb bar shows your navigation history (like breadcrumbs in a forest):

```
Dashboard › Accounts › AT&T › Circuits › ATT/MPLS/00112233
```

Each entry is clickable — you can jump back to any previous page. There's also a "Clear" button to reset the trail.

### File: `client/src/components/Modal.jsx` — Reusable Dialog

The Modal component creates a "popup" form for creating/editing records. It:
- Renders a dark overlay covering the entire screen
- Shows a white card in the center with a title, form content, and Save/Cancel buttons
- Closes when you click the overlay, click X, or click Cancel
- Is reusable — every list page uses the same Modal component with different form fields inside

### File: `client/src/PageTitleContext.js` — Dynamic Page Titles

This uses React's Context API to let detail pages (like AccountDetail) set a custom page title in the header. For example, when viewing AT&T's detail page, the title changes from "Account Detail" to "AT&T".

### File: `client/src/index.css` — Global Styles

This CSS file defines the entire visual design system:

- **Color Palette:** Dark navy sidebar (`#0f172a`), white content area, blue accents (`#3b82f6`)
- **KPI Cards:** 7 color variants (blue, teal, purple, orange, green, red, slate) with icons and numbers
- **Data Tables:** Dark header, alternating white/light-blue rows, hover highlight
- **Forms:** Clean labels, bordered inputs with focus states
- **Badges:** Color-coded status indicators (green for Active, red for Disputed, etc.)
- **Buttons:** Primary (blue), ghost (transparent), danger (red) styles
- **Modals:** Overlay with blur effect, centered card

---

### Invoice Reader (`/invoice-reader`)

**Purpose:** Dynamically parse vendor invoices in EDI, Excel, or PDF format and batch-import their data into the TEMS database. This tool eliminates manual invoice entry for high-volume billing files.

**Supported formats:**
| Format | Extensions | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Excel | `.xlsx`, `.xls`, `.csv` | Reads all sheets; you select which one to use |
| EDI | `.edi`, `.txt` | Parses X12 810 Invoice segments (ISA, BIG, IT1, PID, TDS, DTM) |
| PDF | `.pdf` | Extracts tabular text using whitespace-based column detection |

**Three tabs:**

**Upload & Process tab** — A 4-step wizard:
1. **Upload File** — Drag-and-drop or file picker; optionally select an account and/or apply a saved template
2. **Map Columns** — After the file is parsed, every detected column appears with a sample value and a dropdown to map it to a target field (`invoices.invoice_number`, `invoices.total_amount`, `line_items.amount`, etc.). Excel files show a sheet selector.
3. **Review** — Summary of active mappings, file name, and account. Option to save the mapping as a named template for future reuse.
4. **Results** — Stats: total rows processed, invoices created, line items created, and errors. Any row-level errors are listed with details.

**Saved Templates tab** — Lists all saved column-mapping templates. Each shows format, column count, and linked account. You can click **Use** to pre-load the template for the next upload, or delete templates.

**Upload History tab** — A table of every import run, showing file name, format, status (Pending / Processing / Completed / Failed), row counts, and date.

**How batch insertion works:**
- Rows are grouped by invoice number (if mapped)
- Each unique invoice is inserted into the `invoices` table
- Its line items are inserted into `line_items` in chunks of 500 rows
- Circuit number and USOC code values are auto-resolved to their FK IDs via a pre-loaded lookup cache
- Each run is tracked in `invoice_reader_uploads` regardless of success or failure

## 14. How Data Flows Through the App

Let's trace a complete scenario — creating a new vendor account — to see every piece working together.

### Scenario: Creating a New Account

**Step 1 — User clicks "+ New Account"**
- The `Accounts.jsx` component responds to the click event
- It opens the Modal component with an empty form

**Step 2 — User fills in the form and clicks Save**
- The form data is collected into a JavaScript object:
  ```javascript
  { name: "Sprint Business", account_number: "SPR-12345", vendor_type: "Wireless", ... }
  ```

**Step 3 — The API call is made**
- `Accounts.jsx` calls `createAccount(formData)` from `api.js`
- `api.js` sends: `POST /api/accounts` with the form data as JSON in the request body

**Step 4 — Vite proxy forwards the request**
- The browser sent the request to `http://localhost:2000/api/accounts`
- Vite's proxy forwards it to `http://localhost:2001/api/accounts`

**Step 5 — Express routes the request**
- `server.js` sees the URL starts with `/api/accounts` → hands it to `routes/accounts.js`
- The `router.post('/')` handler matches

**Step 6 — The handler writes to the database**
Knex builds and executes:
```sql
INSERT INTO accounts (name, account_number, vendor_type, ...) VALUES ('Sprint Business', 'SPR-12345', 'Wireless', ...)
```

**Step 7 — The handler reads back the new record**
Knex builds and executes:
```sql
SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE accounts_id = 10  -- 10 is the auto-generated ID
```

**Step 8 — The response is sent back**
- The new account object (with its auto-generated `accounts_id` and `created_at`) is sent as JSON
- HTTP status: 201 (Created)

**Step 9 — The client receives the response**
- `api.js` receives the response and returns the data to `Accounts.jsx`
- `Accounts.jsx` adds the new account to its local state array
- React re-renders the table — the new account appears instantly
- A green toast notification says "Account created"
- The modal closes

### The Entire Trip

```
User clicks Save
     ↓
Accounts.jsx → createAccount(data)
     ↓
api.js → POST http://localhost:2000/api/accounts  (with JSON body)
     ↓
vite proxy → http://localhost:2001/api/accounts
     ↓
server.js → routes/accounts.js → router.post('/')
     ↓
db.insertReturningId('accounts', data)  →  PostgreSQL (via Knex)
     ↓
PostgreSQL inserts the row, Knex returns the new accounts_id (e.g. 10)
     ↓
db('accounts').where('accounts_id', 10).first()  →  PostgreSQL (via Knex)
     ↓
PostgreSQL returns the full account row
     ↓
res.status(201).json(accountRow)  →  HTTP Response
     ↓
api.js receives response → returns to Accounts.jsx
     ↓
Accounts.jsx updates state → React re-renders → New row appears in table
     ↓
Toast notification: "Account created" ✓
```

### How to Add a New Technology/Feature to the Project

If you want to add a new entity (e.g., "Locations"):

1. **Database:** Create a Knex migration in `server/migrations/` (see existing migration for the pattern)
2. **Server Route:** Create `server/routes/locations.js` following the same pattern as other routes
3. **Register Route:** Add `app.use('/api/locations', require('./routes/locations'))` in `server.js`
4. **API Functions:** Add `getLocations`, `getLocation`, `createLocation`, `updateLocation`, `deleteLocation` to `client/src/api.js`
5. **Page Components:** Create `client/src/pages/Locations.jsx` (list page) and optionally `LocationDetail.jsx`
6. **Routing:** Add `<Route path="/locations" element={<Locations />} />` in `App.jsx`
7. **Navigation:** Add an entry to the `NAV` array in `App.jsx`

## 16. Switching Databases

TEMS uses **PostgreSQL** by default, but is built with **Knex.js**, a query builder that generates database-specific SQL automatically. This means you can switch to MySQL or MSSQL by changing configuration — no code changes required.

### How It Works

All database queries are written using Knex's JavaScript API:

```javascript
// This Knex code:
db('accounts').where('status', 'Active').orderBy('name')

// Generates this SQL on MySQL:
// SELECT * FROM `accounts` WHERE `status` = 'Active' ORDER BY `name`

// And this SQL on PostgreSQL:
// SELECT * FROM "accounts" WHERE "status" = 'Active' ORDER BY "name"
```

Knex handles quoting, data types, and syntax differences between databases.

### Step-by-Step: Switch to MySQL

1. **Install the MySQL driver:**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install mysql2
   ```

2. **Update your `.env` file:**
   ```env
   DB_CLIENT=mysql2
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=3306
   DB_USER=root
   DB_PASSWORD=your_password
   DB_NAME=tems
   ```

3. **Create the database:**
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE tems;
   ```

4. **Run Knex migrations to create tables:**
   ```bash
   npm run migrate
   ```

5. **Run Knex seeds to insert demo data:**
   ```bash
   npm run seed
   ```

6. **Start the server** — it now talks to MySQL.

### Step-by-Step: Switch to MSSQL

1. **Install the MSSQL driver:**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install tedious
   ```

2. **Update your `.env` file:**
   ```env
   DB_CLIENT=mssql
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=1433
   DB_USER=sa
   DB_PASSWORD=your_password
   DB_NAME=tems
   ```

3. **Run migrations and seeds as above.**

### Known Differences

| Feature | MySQL | PostgreSQL | MSSQL |
|---|---|---|---|
| `LIKE` case sensitivity | Case-insensitive | Case-sensitive (use `ILIKE`) | Case-insensitive |
| Boolean storage | `TINYINT(1)` | `BOOLEAN` | `BIT` |
| Auto-increment | `AUTO_INCREMENT` | `SERIAL` | `IDENTITY` |
| Default port | 3306 | 5432 | 1433 |

> **Note:** The search route uses `LIKE` which is case-insensitive on MySQL and MSSQL. On PostgreSQL, search would become case-sensitive. To fix this, change `'like'` to `'ilike'` in `routes/search.js`.

## 17. Troubleshooting

### "PostgreSQL connection error" when starting the server

**Cause:** The server can't connect to PostgreSQL.

**Fix:**
1. Make sure PostgreSQL is running: `psql -U postgres` should work
2. Check your `server/.env` file — are the credentials correct?
3. Make sure the `tems` database exists: `\l` in psql to list databases
4. If you changed the PostgreSQL password, update `.env`

### "Cannot find module 'express'" or similar

**Cause:** Dependencies weren't installed.

**Fix:** Run `npm install` in both the `server/` and `client/` folders.

### Client shows a blank white page

**Cause:** Usually a JavaScript error.

**Fix:**
1. Open browser developer tools (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I)
2. Check the **Console** tab for red error messages
3. Common cause: server isn't running, so API calls fail

### "Port 2001 already in use"

**Cause:** Something else is using port 2001.

**Fix:** Change the port in `server/.env`:
```
PORT=2002
```
And update `client/vite.config.js`:
```javascript
proxy: { '/api': { target: 'http://localhost:2002' } }
```

### Data not showing up / empty tables

**Cause:** Seed data wasn't loaded.

**Fix:** Run the Knex seeds:
```bash
cd server
npm run migrate
npm run seed
```

### Changes not appearing after editing a file

**Server files:** If using `npm run dev`, nodemon auto-restarts. If using `npm start`, restart manually.

**Client files:** Vite has Hot Module Replacement — changes should appear instantly. If not, refresh the browser (Ctrl+R).
